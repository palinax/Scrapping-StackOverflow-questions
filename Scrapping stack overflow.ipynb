Can act as a Server and has tons of features.\\n\\nJAVASCRIPT\\n\\nPhantomJS - JavaScript, headless testing with screen capture and automation, uses Webkit. As of version 1.8 Selenium's WebDriver API is implemented, so you can use any WebDriver binding and tests will be compatible with Selenium\\nSlimerJS - similar to PhantomJS, uses Gecko (Firefox) instead of WebKit\\nCasperJS - JavaScript, build on both PhantomJS and SlimerJS, has extra features\\nGhost Driver - JavaScript implementation of the WebDriver Wire Protocol for PhantomJS.\\nnew PhantomCSS - CSS regression testing. A CasperJS module for automating visual regression testing with PhantomJS and Resemble.js.\\nnew WebdriverCSS - plugin for Webdriver.io for automating visual regression testing\\nnew PhantomFlow - Describe and visualize user flows through tests. An experimental approach to Web user interface testing.\\nnew trifleJS - ports the PhantomJS API to use the Internet Explorer engine.\\nnew CasperJS IDE (commercial)\\n\\nNODE.JS\\n\\nNode-phantom - bridges the gap between PhantomJS and node.js\\nWebDriverJs - Selenium WebDriver bindings for node.js by Selenium Team\\nWD.js - node module for WebDriver/Selenium 2\\nyiewd - WD.js wrapper using latest Harmony generators! Get rid of the callback pyramid with yield\\nZombieJs - Insanely fast, headless full-stack testing using node.js\\nNightwatchJs - Node JS based testing solution using Selenium Webdriver\\nChimera - Chimera: can do everything what phantomJS does, but in a full JS environment\\nDalek.js - Automated cross browser testing with JavaScript through Selenium Webdriver\\nWebdriver.io - better implementation of WebDriver bindings with predefined 50+ actions\\nNightmare - Electron bridge with a high-level API.\\njsdom - Tailored towards web scraping. A very lightweight DOM implemented in Node.js, it supports pages with javascript.\\nnew Puppeteer - Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium. Puppeteer runs headless by default.\\n\\nWEB SCRAPING / MINING\\n\\nScrapy - Python, mainly a scraper/miner - fast, well documented and, can be linked with Django Dynamic Scraper for nice mining deployments, or Scrapy Cloud for PaaS (server-less) deployment, works in terminal or an server stand-alone proces, can be used with Celery, built on top of Twisted\\nSnailer - node.js module, untested yet.\\nNode-Crawler - node.js module, untested yet.\\n\\nONLINE TOOLS\\n\\nnew Web Scraping Language - Simple syntax to crawl the web\\n\\nnew Online HTTP client - Dedicated SO answer\\n\\ndead CasperBox - Run CasperJS scripts online\\n\\n\\nAndroid TOOLS for Automation\\n\\nnew Mechanica Browser App\\n\\n\\nRELATED LINKS &amp; RESOURCES\\n\\nComparsion of Webscraping software\\nnew Resemble.js : Image analysis and comparison\\n\\nQuestions:\\n\\nAny pure Node.js solution or Nodejs to PhanthomJS/CasperJS module that actually works and is documented?\\n\\nAnswer: Chimera seems to go in that direction, checkout Chimera\\n\\nOther solutions capable of easier JavaScript injection than Selenium?\\n\\nDo you know any pure ruby solutions?\\n\\n\\nAnswer: Checkout the list created by rjk with ruby based solutions\\n\\nDo you know any related tech or solution?\\n\\nFeel free to edit this question and add content as you wish!

As there is a large number of forms, it would be probably very difficult to write regular expression or even something like a grammar and to use a parser generator for parsing it out.\\nSo I think the way I should go is machine learning. If I understand it well, I should be able to make a sample of data where I will point out what should be the result and then I have something which can learn from this how to recognize the result by itself. This is all I know about machine learning. Maybe I could use some natural language processing, but probably not much as all the libraries work with English mostly and I need this for Czech.\\nQuestions:\\n\\nCan I solve this problem easily by machine learning? Is it a good way to go?\\nAre there any simple examples which would allow me to start? I am machine learning noob and I need something practical for start; closer to my problem is better; simpler is better.\\nThere are plenty of Python libraries for machine learning. Which one would suit my problem best?\\nLots of such libs have not very easy-to-use docs as they come from scientific environment. Are there any good sources (books, articles, quickstarts) bridging the gap, i.e. focused on newbies who know totally nothing about machine learning? Every docs I open start with terms I don't understand such as network, classification, datasets, etc.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nAs you all mentioned I should show a piece of data I am trying to get out of the web, here is an example.

Bývalý učitel dějepisu, který dosáhl vysokého manažerského postu ve významném finančním ústavu, si řadu let spokojeně žije společně se svou rodinou v luxusní vile na okraji Prahy. Bezstarostný život ale netrvá věčně a na povrch začnou vyplouvat machinace s penězi klientů týkající se celého vedení banky. Libor se následně ocitá pod dohledem policejních vyšetřovatelů, kteří mu začnou tvrdě šlapat na paty. Snaží se uniknout před hrozícím vězením a oddálit osvětlení celé situace své nic netušící manželce. Rozhodne se tak pro netradiční útěk, kdy pod záminkou společné dovolené odveze celou rodinu na jižní Moravu…  Rodinný výlet nebo zoufalý úprk před spravedlností?

Neplánuje, neplatí účty, neřeší nic, co může&lt;br&gt;počkat  do zítra. Budování společného života s přételkyní je mu proti srsti  stejně jako dělat kariéru. Aby mohl jezdit na kole, raději pracuje jako  poslíček. Jeho život je neřízená střela, ve které neplatí žádná  pravidla. Ale problémy se na sebe na kupí a je stále těžší před nimi  ujet …&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;\\n\\n&lt;strong&gt;VE STÍNU&amp;nbsp; 18.10.-24.10. ve 20:30 a 20.10.-22.10. též v 16:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Krimi.

Z běžné vloupačky  se ale vlivem zákulisních intrik tajné policie začíná stávat politická  kauza. Z nařízení Státní bezpečnosti přebírá Haklovo vyšetřování major  Zenke (Sebastian Koch), policejní specialista z NDR, pod jehož vedením  se vyšetřování ubírá jiným směrem, než Haklovi napovídá instinkt  zkušeného kriminalisty. Na vlastní pěst pokračuje ve vyšetřování. Může  jediný spravedlivý obstát v boji s dobře propojenou sítí komunistické  policie?&amp;nbsp; Protivník je silný a Hakl se brzy přesvědčuje, že věřit nelze  nikomu a ničemu.

Jedné  malé vesničce se však daří statečně odolávat, ale každým dnem je slabší a  slabší. Britská královna proto vyslala svého věrného důstojníka  Anticlimaxe, aby vyhledal pomoc u Galů v druhé malinké vesničce ve  Francii vyhlášené svým důmyslným bojem proti Římanům… Když Anticlimax  popsal zoufalou situaci svých lidí, Galové mu darovali barel svého  kouzelného lektvaru a Astérix a Obélix jsou pověřeni doprovodit ho domů.  Jakmile dorazí do Británie, Anticlimax jim představí místní zvyky ve  vší parádě a všichni to pořádně roztočí! Vytočený Caesar se však  rozhodne naverbovat Normanďany, hrůzu nahánějící bojovníky Severu, aby  jednou provždy skoncovali s Brity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\n\\nOr it can look like anything similar to this.

By resolved I mean that the webservice will firstly get the page at that URL, then use PhantomJS to 'render' the page, and then return the resulting source after all DHTML, AJAX calls etc are executed. However launching phantom on a per-request basis (which I'm doing now) is way too sluggish. I would rather have a pool of PhantomJS instances with one always available to serve the latest call to my webservice.\\nHas any work been done on this kind of thing before? I'd rather base this webservice on the work of others than write a pool manager / http proxy server for myself from scratch.\\nMore Context: I've listed the 2 similar projects that I've seen so far below and why I've avoided each one, resulting in this question about managing a pool of PhantomJS instances instead.\\njsdom - from what I've seen it has great functionality for executing scripts on a page, but it doesn't attempt to replicate browser behaviour, so if I were use it as a general purpose \"DOM resolver\" there'd end up being a lot of extra coding to handle all kinds of edges cases, event calling, etc. The first example I saw was having to manually call the onload() function of the body tag for a test app I set up using node. It seemed like the beginning of a deep rabbit hole.\\nSelenium - It just has soo many more moving parts, so setting up a pool to manage long lived browser instances will just be more complicated than using PhantomJS. I don't need any of it's macro recording / scripting benefits. I just want a webservice that is as performant at getting a webpage and resolving it's DOM as if I were browsing to that URL with a browser (or even faster if I can make it ignore images etc.)</td>\n",

For this purpose, instead of going to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-image/pehaalcefcjfccdpbckoablngfkfgfgj\\nyou can go to http://chrome-extension-downloader.com/\\nand paste the extension url there to be able to download the extension file.\\n3- Then you will be able to use the above mentioned code with the path to the extension file that you have downloaded.</td>\n",

Each page has the same HTML layout, just scraping different information.  I use Selenium with a headless browser as these pages have javascript that needs to execute to grab the information.\\nI run this script on my local machine (OSX 10.10).  Firefox is the latest v59.  Selenium is version at 3.11.0 and using geckodriver v0.20.  \\nThis script locally has no issues, it can run through all the URLs and scrape the pages with no issue.\\nNow when I put the script on my server, the only difference is it is Ubuntu 16.04 (32 bit).  I use the appropriate geckodriver (still v0.20) but everything else is the same (Python 2.7, Selenium 3.11).  It appears to randomly crash the headless browser and then all of the browserObjt.get('url...') no longer work.  \\nThe error messages say:\\n\\nMessage: failed to decode response from marionette\\n\\nAny further selenium requests for pages return the error:\\n\\nMessage: tried to run command without establishing a connection\\n\\n\\nTo show some code:\\nWhen I create the driver:\\n    options = Options()\\n    options.set_headless(headless=True)\\n\\n    driver = webdriver.Firefox(\\n        firefox_options=options,\\n        executable_path=config.GECKODRIVER\\n    )\\n\\ndriver is passed to the script's function as a parameter browserObj which is then used to call specific pages and then once that loads it is passed to BeautifulSoup for parsing:\\nbrowserObj.get(url)\\n\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(browserObj.page_source, 'lxml')\\n\\n\\nThe error might be pointing to the BeautifulSoup line which is crashing the browser.\\nWhat is likely causing this, and what can I do to resolve the issue?\\n\\nEdit: Adding stack trace which points to the same thing:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"main.py\", line 164, in &lt;module&gt;\\n    getLeague\\n  File \"/home/ps/dataparsing/XXX/yyy.py\", line 48, in BBB\\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(browserObj.page_source, 'lxml')\\n  File \"/home/ps/AAA/projenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py\", line 670, in page_source\\n    return self.execute(Command.GET_PAGE_SOURCE)['value']\\n  File \"/home/ps/AAA/projenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py\", line 312, in execute\\n    self.error_handler.check_response(response)\\n  File \"/home/ps/AAA/projenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/errorhandler.py\", line 242, in check_response\\n    raise exception_class(message, screen, stacktrace)\\nWebDriverException: Message: Failed to decode response from marionette\\n\\n\\nNote: This script used to work with Chrome.

I want to extract plain text without HTML markup. My code works on plain (static) HTML, but not when content is generated by JavaScript embedded in the page.\\nIn particular, when I use urllib2.urlopen(request) to read the page content, it doesn't show anything that would be added by the JavaScript code, because that code isn't executed anywhere. Normally it would be run by the web browser, but that isn't a part of my program.\\nHow can I access this dynamic content from within my Python code?\\n\\nSee also Can scrapy be used to scrape dynamic content from websites that are using AJAX? for answers specific to Scrapy.  \n",

Up until now, I was using the HtmlUnit headless browser for parsing and browser automation.\\nNow, I want to separate both the tasks.\\nI want to use a light HTML parser because it takes much time in HtmlUnit to first load a page, then get the source and then parse it.\\nI want to know which HTML parser can parse HTML efficiently. I need\\n\\nSpeed\\nEase to locate any HtmlElement by its \"id\" or \"name\" or \"tag type\".\\n\\nIt would be ok for me if it doesn't clean the dirty HTML code. I don't need to clean any HTML source. I just need an easiest way to move across HtmlElements and harvest data from them.  \n",

wikipedia page on the Brazilian soccer team. I would like to read it in R and get the \"list of all matches Brazil have played against FIFA recognised teams\" table as a data.frame. How can I do this?  \n",

following code, to find the td tag whose class is 'empformbody':\\nimport urllib\\nimport urllib2\\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\\n\\nurl =  \"http://www.example.com/servlet/av/ResultTemplate=AVResult.html\"\\nreq = urllib2.Request(url)\\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(req)\\nthe_page = response.read()\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(the_page)\\n\\nsoup.findAll('td',attrs={'class':'empformbody'})\\n\\nNow in the above code we can use findAll to get tags and information related to them, but I want to use XPath. Is it possible to use XPath with BeautifulSoup? If possible, please provide me example code.  \n",

                                       Basically, I want to use BeautifulSoup to grab strictly the visible text on a webpage. For instance, this webpage is my test case. And I mainly want to just get the body text (article) and maybe even a few tab names here and there. I have tried the suggestion in this SO question that returns lots of <script> tags and html comments which I don't want. I can't figure out the arguments I need for the function findAll() in order to just get the visible texts on a webpage.\\nSo, how should I find all visible text excluding scripts, comments, css etc.?  \n",

to scrape product information from a webpage, using scrapy. My to-be-scraped webpage looks like this:\\n\\nstarts with a product_list page with 10 products\\na click on \"next\"  button loads the next 10 products (url doesn't change between the two pages)\\ni use LinkExtractor to follow each product link into the product page, and get all the information I need\\n\\nI tried to replicate the next-button-ajax-call but can't get working, so I'm giving selenium a try. I can run selenium's webdriver in a separate script, but I don't know how to integrate with scrapy. Where shall I put the selenium part in my scrapy spider? \\nMy spider is pretty standard, like the following:\\nclass ProductSpider(CrawlSpider):\\n    name = \"product_spider\"\\n    allowed_domains = ['example.com']\\n    start_urls = ['http://example.com/shanghai']\\n    rules = [\\n        Rule(SgmlLinkExtractor(restrict_xpaths='//div[@id=\"productList\"]//dl[@class=\"t2\"]//dt'), callback='parse_product'),\\n        ]\\n\\n    def parse_product(self, response):\\n        self.log(\"parsing product %s\" %response.url, level=INFO)\\n        hxs = HtmlXPathSelector(response)\\n        # actual data follows\\n\\nAny idea is appreciated.

                                                    If I want to scrape a website that requires login with password first, how can I start scraping it with python using beautifulsoup4 library? Below is what I do for websites that do not require login. \\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup    \\nimport urllib2 \\nurl = urllib2.urlopen(\"http://www.python.org\")    \\ncontent = url.read()    \\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(content)\\n\\nHow should the code be changed to accommodate login? Assume that the website I want to scrape is a forum that requires login. An example is http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php  \n",

(http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) but the page I am trying to get to uses javascript to fetch the info that I want. \\nI have tried to search on the web for a solution but the fact that I am searching with the keyword javascript most of the stuff I am getting is how to scrape with the javascript language.\\nIs there anyway to use the requests framework with pages that use javascript?

       "23  I would like to extract a specific type of information from web pages in Python. Let's say postal address. It has thousands of forms, but still, it is somehow recognizable. As there is a large number of forms, it would be probably very difficult to write regular expression or even something like a grammar and to use a parser generator for parsing it out.\\nSo I think the way I should go is machine learning. If I understand it well, I should be able to make a sample of data where I will point out what should be the result and then I have something which can learn from this how to recognize the result by itself. This is all I know about machine learning. Maybe I could use some natural language processing, but probably not much as all the libraries work with English mostly and I need this for Czech.\\nQuestions:\\n\\nCan I solve this problem easily by machine learning? Is it a good way to go?\\nAre there any simple examples which would allow me to start? I am machine learning noob and I need something practical for start; closer to my problem is better; simpler is better.\\nThere are plenty of Python libraries for machine learning. Which one would suit my problem best?\\nLots of such libs have not very easy-to-use docs as they come from scientific environment. Are there any good sources (books, articles, quickstarts) bridging the gap, i.e. focused on newbies who know totally nothing about machine learning? Every docs I open start with terms I don't understand such as network, classification, datasets, etc.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nAs you all mentioned I should show a piece of data I am trying to get out of the web, here is an example.

Bezstarostný život ale netrvá věčně a na povrch začnou vyplouvat machinace s penězi klientů týkající se celého vedení banky. Libor se následně ocitá pod dohledem policejních vyšetřovatelů, kteří mu začnou tvrdě šlapat na paty. Snaží se uniknout před hrozícím vězením a oddálit osvětlení celé situace své nic netušící manželce.

Jedné  malé vesničce se však daří statečně odolávat, ale každým dnem je slabší a  slabší. Britská královna proto vyslala svého věrného důstojníka  Anticlimaxe, aby vyhledal pomoc u Galů v druhé malinké vesničce ve  Francii vyhlášené svým důmyslným bojem proti Římanům… Když Anticlimax  popsal zoufalou situaci svých lidí, Galové mu darovali barel svého  kouzelného lektvaru a Astérix a Obélix jsou pověřeni doprovodit ho domů.  Jakmile dorazí do Británie, Anticlimax jim představí místní zvyky ve  vší parádě a všichni to pořádně roztočí!

url,\\nlogs in (there is steam oauth),\\nfills some inputs,\\nand clicks 2 buttons.\\n\\nMy problem is that every new instance of headless browser clears my login session, and then I need to login again and again...\\nHow to save it through instances? (using puppeteer with headless chrome)\\nOr how can I open already logged in chrome headless instance? (if I have already logged in in my main chrome window)  \n",

the best options for performing Web Scraping of a not currently open tab from within a Google Chrome Extension with JavaScript and whatever more technologies are available. Other JavaScript-libraries are also accepted.\\nThe important thing is to mask the scraping to behave like a normal web-request. No indications of AJAX or XMLHttpRequest, like X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest or Origin.\\nThe scraped content must be accessible from JavaScript for further manipulation and presentation within the extension, most probably as a string.\\nAre there any hooks in any WebKit/Chrome-specific API:s that can be used to make a normal web-request and get the results for manipulation?\\nvar pageContent = getPageContent(url); // TODO: Implement\\nvar items = $(pageContent).find('.item');\\n// Display items with further selections\\n\\nBonus-points to make this work from a local file on disk, for initial debugging. But if that is the only point is stopping a solution, then disregard the bonus-points.  \n",

The site which I need to scrape does not provide any API as well; I want to iterate over all web pages using some pageID and extract the HTML titles / other stuff in their DOM trees.\\nAre there ways other than web scraping?  \n",

BeautifulSoup\\nimport urllib2\\n\\nurl = 'http://www.thefamouspeople.com/singers.php'\\nhtml = urllib2.urlopen(url)\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html)\\n\\nBut I found that I have to install urllib3 package now.\\nMoreover, I couldn't find any tutorial or example to understand how to rewrite the above code, for example, urllib3 does not have urlopen.\\nAny explanation or example, please?!\\nP/S: I'm using python 3.4.  \n",

dense. I want to select all <td> elements on a particular page via Chrome's JS console:\\n$('td')\\n\\nYet when I do this, I get the following output:\\n<td>Apples</td>\\n\\nIsn't jQuery supposed to return an array of elements with the <td> tag? Why am I only seeing the first element that matches this criteria?\\nHere is the site in question: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\\nEDIT: I'd like to add that when I type a jQuery function into Chrome console, I do NOT get a jQuery object back. I get a plain HTML element. Something must be wrong with the way my Chrome is set-up/configured.  \n",

following page: http://search.cpsa.ca/PhysicianSearch\\nIn order to simulate clicking the 'Search' button without filling out any of the form, which adds data to the page. I got the POST header information by clicking on the button while looking at the network tab in Chrome Developer Tools. The reason I'm posting this instead of just copying solutions from the other similar problems is that I believe I may have not gotten the correct header information.\\nIs it properly formatted and did I grab the right information? I've never made a POST request before.\\nThis is what I've managed to piece together:\\nimport urllib.parse\\nimport urllib.request\\n\\n\\ndata = urllib.parse.urlencode({'Host': 'search.cpsa.ca', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'Content-Length': 23796,\\n                                     'Origin': 'http://search.cpsa.ca', 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8',\\n                                     'Cahce-Control': 'no-cache', 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',\\n                                     'X-MicrosoftAjax': 'Delta=true', 'Accept': '*/*',\\n                                     'Referer': 'http://search.cpsa.ca/PhysicianSearch',\\n                                     'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',\\n                                     'Accept-Language': 'en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6',\\n                                     'Cookie': 'ASP.NET_SessionId=kcwsgio3dchqjmyjtwue402c; _ga=GA1.2.412607756.1459536682; _gat=1'})\\n\\n\\nurl = \"http://www.musi-cal.com/cgi-bin/query?%s\"\\n\\ndata = data.encode('ascii')\\nwith urllib.request.urlopen(\"http://search.cpsa.ca/PhysicianSearch\", data) as f:\\n    print(f.read().decode('utf-8'))\\n\\nThis solution outputs the page's HTML, but not with any of the data I wanted to retrieve from the POST request.  \n",

Exception: clause, and do print(exception). The result provides no information since it always prints <class 'Exception'>. I knew this used to work in python 2, but how do I do it in python3?  \n",

Some of the information I need only pops up when you click on a certain button (of course also appears in the HTML code after clicking).\\nI found out that Scrapy can handle forms (like logins) as shown here. But the problem is that there is no form to fill out, so it's not exactly what I need.\\nHow can I simply click a button, which then shows the information I need?\\nDo I have to use an external library like mechanize or lxml?  \n",

<strong class=\"offender\">GENDER:</strong> FEMALE<br/>\\n  <strong class=\"offender\">HEIGHT:</strong> 5'05''<br/>\\n  <strong class=\"offender\">WEIGHT:</strong> 118<br/>\\n  <strong class=\"offender\">EYE COLOR:</strong> GREEN<br/>\\n  <strong class=\"offender\">HAIR COLOR:</strong> BROWN<br/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI want to extract the info for each individual and get YOB:1987, RACE:WHITE, etc...\\nWhat I tried is:\\nsubc = soup.find_all('p')\\nsubc1 = subc[1]\\nsubc2 = subc1.find_all('strong')\\n\\nBut this gives me only the values of YOB:, RACE:, etc...\\nIs there a way that I can get the data in YOB:1987, RACE:WHITE format?  \n",

for my own use internally that takes one argument, a URL, and returns html representing the resolved DOM from that URL. By resolved I mean that the webservice will firstly get the page at that URL, then use PhantomJS to 'render' the page, and then return the resulting source after all DHTML, AJAX calls etc are executed. However launching phantom on a per-request basis (which I'm doing now) is way too sluggish. I would rather have a pool of PhantomJS instances with one always available to serve the latest call to my webservice.\\nHas any work been done on this kind of thing before? I'd rather base this webservice on the work of others than write a pool manager / http proxy server for myself from scratch.\\nMore Context: I've listed the 2 similar projects that I've seen so far below and why I've avoided each one, resulting in this question about managing a pool of PhantomJS instances instead.\\njsdom - from what I've seen it has great functionality for executing scripts on a page, but it doesn't attempt to replicate browser behaviour, so if I were use it as a general purpose \"DOM resolver\" there'd end up being a lot of extra coding to handle all kinds of edges cases, event calling, etc. The first example I saw was having to manually call the onload() function of the body tag for a test app I set up using node. It seemed like the beginning of a deep rabbit hole.\\nSelenium - It just has soo many more moving parts, so setting up a pool to manage long lived browser instances will just be more complicated than using PhantomJS. I don't need any of it's macro recording / scripting benefits. I just want a webservice that is as performant at getting a webpage and resolving it's DOM as if I were browsing to that URL with a browser (or even faster if I can make it ignore images etc.)  \n",

I'd like to build something very, very fast that can execute searches in the style of kayak.com, where one query is dispatched to several different sites, the results scraped, and returned to the client as they become available.\\nLet's assume that this script should just provide the results in JSON format, and we can process them either directly in the browser or in another web application.\\nA few starting points:\\nUsing node.js and jquery to scrape websites\\nAnybody have any ideas?  \n",

 Given a news article webpage (from any major news source such as times or bloomberg), I want to  identify the main article content on that page and throw out the other misc elements such as ads, menus, sidebars, user comments. \\nWhat's a generic way of doing this that will work on most major news sites?  \\nWhat are some good tools or libraries for data mining? (preferably python based)  \n",

csv.\\nI'm trying this code: \\nwith open('Sprint_data.csv', 'ab') as csvfile:\\n  spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)\\n  models = soup.find_all('li' , {\"class\" : \"phoneListing\"})\\n\\n  for model in models:\\n\\n      model_name = unicode(u' '.join(model.a.stripped_strings)).encode('utf8').strip()\\n      spamwriter.writerow(unicode(u' '.join(model.a.stripped_strings)).encode('utf8').strip())\\n\\nIt's working fine except each cell in the csv contains only one character.\\nLike this: \\n|  S  |  A  |   M  |   S  |   U   |  N  |   G   |\\n\\nInstead of:\\n|SAMSUNG|\\n\\nOf course I'm missing something. But what?  \n",

I can't find a decent example, the documentation seems to be all about command line use.  \n",

                                      I spend a lot of time searching about this.\\nAt the end of the day I combined a number of answers and it works. I share my answer and I'll appreciate it if anyone edits it or provides us with an easier way to do this.\\n1- The answer in Disable images in Selenium Google ChromeDriver works in Java. So we should do the same thing in Python:\\nopt = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\\nopt.add_extension(\"Block-image_v1.1.crx\")\\nbrowser = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=opt)\\n\\n2- But downloading \"Block-image_v1.1.crx\" is a little bit tricky, because there is no direct way to do that. For this purpose, instead of going to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-image/pehaalcefcjfccdpbckoablngfkfgfgj\\nyou can go to http://chrome-extension-downloader.com/\\nand paste the extension url there to be able to download the extension file.\\n3- Then you will be able to use the above mentioned code with the path to the extension file that you have downloaded.  \n",

I want to download file from clicking event using selenium. I wrote following code.  \\nfrom selenium import webdriver\\nfrom selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\\n\\nbrowser = webdriver.Firefox()\\nbrowser.get(\"http://www.drugcite.com/?q=ACTIMMUNE\")\\n\\nbrowser.close()\\n\\nI want to download both files from links with name \"Export Data\" from given url. How can I achieve it as it works with click event only?  \n",

Well, I'm pretty much trying to figure out how to pull information from a webpage, and bring it into my program (in Java). \\nFor example, if I know the exact page I want info from, for the sake of simplicity a Best Buy item page, how would I get the appropriate info I need off of that page? Like the title, price, description? \\nWhat would this process even be called? I have no idea were to even begin researching this.\\nEdit:\\nOkay, I'm running a test for the JSoup(the one posted by BalusC), but I keep getting this error:\\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.util.LinkedList.peekFirst()Ljava/lang/Object;\\nat org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.consumeWord(TokenQueue.java:209)\\nat org.jsoup.parser.Parser.parseStartTag(Parser.java:117)\\nat org.jsoup.parser.Parser.parse(Parser.java:76)\\nat org.jsoup.parser.Parser.parse(Parser.java:51)\\nat org.jsoup.Jsoup.parse(Jsoup.java:28)\\nat org.jsoup.Jsoup.parse(Jsoup.java:56)\\nat test.main(test.java:12)\\n\\nI do have Apache Commons  \n",

domain + '/', { timeout: 60000, waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });\\n    } catch (error) {\\n        try {\\n            await page.goto('http://' + domain + '/', { timeout: 120000, waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });\\n            screenshot = await page.screenshot({ type: 'png', encoding: 'base64' });\\n        } catch (error) {\\n            console.error('Connecting to: ' + domain + ' failed due to: ' + error);\\n        }\\n\\n    await page.close();\\n    await browser.close();\\n\\n    return screenshot;\\n}\\n\\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\\n    const numOfWorkers = require('os').cpus().length;\\n    for (let worker = 0; worker < numOfWorkers; worker++) {\\n        cluster.fork();\\n    }\\n\\n    cluster.on('exit', function (worker, code, signal) {\\n        console.debug('Worker ' + worker.process.pid + ' died with code: ' + code + ', and signal: ' + signal);\\n        Cluster.fork();\\n    });\\n\\n    cluster.on('message', function (handler, msg) {\\n        console.debug('Worker: ' + handler.process.pid + ' has finished working on ' + msg.domain + '. Exiting...');\\n        if (Cluster.workers[handler.id]) {\\n            Cluster.workers[handler.id].kill('SIGTERM');\\n        }\\n    });\\n} else {\\n    const app = express();\\n    app.use(bodyParser.json());\\n    app.listen(80, function() {\\n        console.debug('Worker ' + process.pid + ' is listening to incoming messages');\\n    });\\n\\n    app.post('/screenshot', (req, res) => {\\n        const domain = req.body.domain;\\n\\n        getScreenshot(domain)\\n            .then((screenshot) =>\\n                try {\\n                    process.send({ domain: domain });\\n                } catch (error) {\\n                    console.error('Error while exiting worker ' + process.pid + ' due to: ' + error);\\n                }\\n\\n                res.status(200).json({ screenshot: screenshot });\\n            })\\n            .catch((error) => {\\n                try {\\n                    process.send({ domain: domain });\\n                } catch (error) {\\n                    console.error('Error while exiting worker ' + process.pid + ' due to: ' + error);\\n                }\\n\\n                res.status(500).json({ error: error });\\n            });\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nSome explanation:\\n\\nEach time a request arrives a worker will process it and kill itself at the end\\nEach worker creates a new browser instance with a single page, and if a page took more than 60sec to load, it will retry reloading it (in the same page because maybe some resources has already been loaded) with timeout of 120sec\\nOnce finished both the page and the browser will be closed\\n\\nMy problem is that some legitimate domains get errors that I can't explain:\\nError: Protocol error (Page.navigate): Target closed.\\n\\nError: Protocol error (Runtime.callFunctionOn): Session closed. Most likely the page has been closed.\\n\\nI read at some git issue (that I can't find now) that it can happen when the page redirects and adds 'www' at the start, but I'm hoping it's false...\\nIs there something I'm missing?  \n",

                                 I want to be able to select/highlight an element on the page and find its selector like this:\\n\\ndiv.firstRow\\n  div.priceAvail>div>div.PriceCompare>div.BodyS\\n\\nI know you can see the selection on the bottom after doing an inspect element, but how can I copy this path to the clipboard? In Firebug I think you can do this, but don't see a way to do this using the Chrome Developer Tools and search for an extension did not turn-up anything.\\nThis is what I am trying to do for more reference:\\nhttp://asciicasts.com/episodes/173-screen-scraping-with-scrapi  \n",

that return JSON? For example, the JSON would look like this:\\n{\\n    \"firstName\": \"John\",\\n    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\\n    \"age\": 25,\\n    \"address\": {\\n        \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\\n        \"city\": \"New York\",\\n        \"state\": \"NY\",\\n        \"postalCode\": \"10021\"\\n    },\\n    \"phoneNumber\": [\\n        {\\n            \"type\": \"home\",\\n            \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"type\": \"fax\",\\n            \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n\\nI would be looking to scrape specific items (e.g. name and fax in the above) and save to csv.  \n",

oneoff tasks in Haskell, in order to help increase my comfort level with the language. \\nIn Python, I tend to use the excellent PyQuery library for this.  Is there something similarly simple and easy in Haskell?  I've looked into Tag Soup, and while the parser itself seems nice, actually traversing pages doesn't seem as nice as it is in other languages.\\nIs there a better option out there?  \n",

Specifically I need data contained in a number of div tags which use a specific CSS class - Currently (for testing purposes) I'm just checking for \\ndiv class = \"classname\"\\n\\nin each line of HTML - This works, but I can't help but feel there is a better solution out there.  \\nIs there any nice way where I could give a class a line of HTML and have some nice methods like:\\nboolean usesClass(String CSSClassname);\\nString getText();\\nString getLink();  \n",

                                                I am practicing Selenium in Python and I wanted to fetch all the links on a web page using Selenium.\\nFor example, I want all the links in the href= property of all the <a> tags on http://psychoticelites.com/\\nI've written a script and it is working. But, it's giving me the object address. I've tried using the id tag to get the value, but, it doesn't work.\\nMy current script:\\nfrom selenium import webdriver\\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\\n\\n\\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox()\\ndriver.get(\"http://psychoticelites.com/\")\\n\\nassert \"Psychotic\" in driver.title\\n\\ncontinue_link = driver.find_element_by_tag_name('a')\\nelem = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\"//*[@href]\")\\n#x = str(continue_link)\\n#print(continue_link)\\nprint(elem)  \n",

Python-Scrapy for getting data from koovs.com. \\nHowever, I'm not able to get the product size, which is dynamically generated. Specifically, if someone could guide me a little on getting the 'Not available' size tag from the drop-down menu on this link, I'd be grateful. \\nI am able to get the size list statically, but doing that I only get the list of sizes but not which of them are available.  \n",

the bottom (infinite scrolling). I have tried doing different things with Phantomjs but not able to gather links beyond first page. Let say the element at the bottom which loads content has class .has-more-items. It is available until final content is loaded while scrolling and then becomes unavailable in DOM (display:none). Here are the things I have tried-\\n\\nSetting viewportSize to a large height right after var page = require('webpage').create();\\n\\n\\npage.viewportSize = {             width: 1600,            height: 10000,\\n          };\\n\\n\\nUsing page.scrollPosition = { top: 10000, left: 0 } inside page.open but have no effect like-\\n\\n\\npage.open('http://example.com/?q=houston', function(status) {\\n   if (status == \"success\") {\\n      page.scrollPosition = { top: 10000, left: 0 };  \\n   }\\n});\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso tried putting it inside page.evaluate function but that gives \\n\\n\\nReference error: Can't find variable page\\n\\n\\nTried using jQuery and JS code inside page.evaluate and page.open but to no avail-\\n\\n\\n$(\"html, body\").animate({ scrollTop: $(document).height() }, 10,\\n  function() {\\n          //console.log('check for execution');\\n      });\\n\\nas it is and also inside document.ready. Similarly for JS code-\\nwindow.scrollBy(0,10000)\\n\\nas it is and also inside window.onload\\nI am really struck on it for 2 days now and not able to find a way. Any help or hint would be appreciated.\\nUpdate\\nI have found a helpful piece of code at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/phantomjs/8LrWRW8ZrA0\\nvar hitRockBottom = false; while (!hitRockBottom) {\\n    // Scroll the page (not sure if this is the best way to do so...)\\n    page.scrollPosition = { top: page.scrollPosition + 1000, left: 0 };\\n\\n    // Check if we've hit the bottom\\n    hitRockBottom = page.evaluate(function() {\\n        return document.querySelector(\".has-more-items\") === null;\\n    }); }\\n\\nWhere .has-more-items is the element class I want to access which is available at the bottom of the page initially and as we scroll down, it moves further down until all data is loaded and then becomes unavailable.\\nHowever, when I tested it is clear that it is running into infinite loops without scrolling down (I render pictures to check). I have tried to replace page.scrollPosition = { top: page.scrollPosition + 1000, left: 0 }; with codes from below as well (one at a time)\\nwindow.document.body.scrollTop = '1000';\\nlocation.href = \".has-more-items\";\\npage.scrollPosition = { top: page.scrollPosition + 1000, left: 0 };\\ndocument.location.href=\".has-more-items\";\\n\\nBut nothing seems to work.  \n",

</td>\\n</tr>\\n...\\n\\nThe code below returns first found value, so I need to filter by \"Fixed text:\" somehow.\\nresult = soup.find('td', {'class' :'pos'}).find('strong').text\\n\\nUPDATE: If I use the following code:\\ntitle = soup.find('td', text = re.compile(ur'Fixed text:(.*)', re.DOTALL), attrs = {'class': 'pos'})\\nself.response.out.write(str(title.string).decode('utf8'))\\n\\nthen it returns just Fixed text:, not the <strong>-highlighted text in that same element.  \n",

My question is very simple: How do you find a link and then how do you click on it?  For instance: The following is the HTML that I am trying to web-scrape:\\n<td bgcolor=\"#E7EFF9\">\\n  <a href=\"javascript:selectDodasaDetdasdasy(220011643,'Kdasdası');\" target=\"_self\">\\n   Details\\n  </a>\\n</td>\\n\\nSo, as you can see the word \"Details\" is a link.\\nHow can I find that link using Selenium and click on it?  \n",

Specifically the browser fingerprinting.\\nWhen I launch an instance of Chrome through Selenium/chromedriver and test against reCAPTCHA 3 (https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/recaptcha-v3-request-scores.php) I always get a score of 0.1 when using Selenium/chromedriver.\\nWhen using incognito with a normal instance, I get 0.3.\\nI've beaten other detection systems by injecting JavaScript and modifying the web driver object and recompiling webdriver from source and modifying the $cdc_ variables.\\nI can see what looks like some obfuscated POST back to the server, so I'm going to start digging there.\\nWhat might it be looking for to determine if I'm running Selenium/chromedriver?  \n",

I am working on a web-scraping project. One of the websites I am working with has the data coming from Javascript.\\nThere was a suggestion on one of my earlier questions that I can directly call the Javascript from Python, but I'm not sure how to accomplish this.\\nFor example: If a JavaScript function is defined as: add_2(var,var2)\\nHow would I call that JavaScript function from Python?  \n",

Recently I've decided to migrate to .NET framework and write the same application in C# (this decision wasn't mine).\\nIn Python, I've used the Mechanize library. However, I can't seem to find anything similar in .NET. What I need is a browser that will run in a headless mode, which has the ability to fill out forms, submit them, etc. JavaScript parser is not a must, but it would be quite useful.  \n",

 If my class names are constantly different say for example:\\nlisting-col-line-3-11 dpt 41\\nlisting-col-block-1-22 dpt 41\\nlisting-col-line-4-13 CWK 12\\n\\nNormally I could do:\\nfor EachPart in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\" : \"ClassNamesHere\"}):\\n            print EachPart.get_text()\\n\\nThere are way too many class names to work with here so a bunch of these are out.\\nI know Python doesn't have a \".contains\" I would normally use but it does have an \"in\". Though I haven't been able to work out a way to incorporate that.\\nI'm hoping there's a way to do this with regex. Though again my Python syntax is really letting me down I've been trying variations on:\\nregex = re.compile('.*listing-col-.*')\\n    for EachPart in soup.find_all(regex):\\n\\nBut that doesn't seem to be doing the trick.  \n",

the user in PHP.\\nI'd like to retrieve only the title of the page, an image (like the logo of the website) and a bit of text or a description if it's available. Is there any simple way to do this without any external libraries/classes? Thanks\\nSo far I've tried using the DOCDocument class, loading the HTML and displaying it on the screen, but I don't think that's the proper way to do it  \n",

BeautifulSoup for web scraping.\\nLets say I have the following html code to scrape:\\n<body>\\n    <div class=\"product\">Product 1</div>\\n    <div class=\"product\">Product 2</div>\\n    <div class=\"product special\">Product 3</div>\\n    <div class=\"product special\">Product 4</div>\\n</body>\\n\\nUsing BeautifulSoup, I want to find ONLY the products with the attribute class=\"product\"\\n(only Product 1 and 2), not the 'special' products\\nIf I do the following:\\nresult = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'product'})\\n\\nthe result includes ALL the products (1,2,3, and 4).\\nWhat should I do to find products whose class EXACTLY matches 'product'??\\n\\nThe Code I ran:\\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\\nimport re\\n\\ntext = \"\"\"\\n<body>\\n    <div class=\"product\">Product 1</div>\\n    <div class=\"product\">Product 2</div>\\n    <div class=\"product special\">Product 3</div>\\n    <div class=\"product special\">Product 4</div>\\n</body>\"\"\"\\n\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(text)\\nresult = soup.findAll(attrs={'class': re.compile(r\"^product$\")})\\nprint result\\n\\nOutput:\\n[<div class=\"product\">Product 1</div>, <div class=\"product\">Product 2</div>, <div class=\"product special\">Product 3</div>, <div class=\"product special\">Product 4</div>]  \n",

So far, I've found Chafe, but this seems poorly-documented and maintained. I'm wondering if anyone out there has done scraping with Scala and has advice. (I'm trying to integrate into an existing Scala framework rather than use a scraper written in, say, Python.)  \n",

Each page has the same HTML layout, just scraping different information.  I use Selenium with a headless browser as these pages have javascript that needs to execute to grab the information.\\nI run this script on my local machine (OSX 10.10).  Firefox is the latest v59.  Selenium is version at 3.11.0 and using geckodriver v0.20.  \\nThis script locally has no issues, it can run through all the URLs and scrape the pages with no issue.\\nNow when I put the script on my server, the only difference is it is Ubuntu 16.04 (32 bit).  I use the appropriate geckodriver (still v0.20) but everything else is the same (Python 2.7, Selenium 3.11).  It appears to randomly crash the headless browser and then all of the browserObjt.get('url...') no longer work.  \\nThe error messages say:\\n\\nMessage: failed to decode response from marionette\\n\\nAny further selenium requests for pages return the error:\\n\\nMessage: tried to run command without establishing a connection\\n\\n\\nTo show some code:\\nWhen I create the driver:\\n    options = Options()\\n    options.set_headless(headless=True)\\n\\n    driver = webdriver.Firefox(\\n        firefox_options=options,\\n        executable_path=config.GECKODRIVER\\n    )\\n\\ndriver is passed to the script's function as a parameter browserObj which is then used to call specific pages and then once that loads it is passed to BeautifulSoup for parsing:\\nbrowserObj.get(url)\\n\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(browserObj.page_source, 'lxml')\\n\\n\\nThe error might be pointing to the BeautifulSoup line which is crashing the browser.\\nWhat is likely causing this, and what can I do to resolve the issue?\\n\\nEdit: Adding stack trace which points to the same thing:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"main.py\", line 164, in <module>\\n    getLeague\\n  File \"/home/ps/dataparsing/XXX/yyy.py\", line 48, in BBB\\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(browserObj.page_source, 'lxml')\\n  File \"/home/ps/AAA/projenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py\", line 670, in page_source\\n    return self.execute(Command.GET_PAGE_SOURCE)['value']\\n  File \"/home/ps/AAA/projenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py\", line 312, in execute\\n    self.error_handler.check_response(response)\\n  File \"/home/ps/AAA/projenv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/errorhandler.py\", line 242, in check_response\\n    raise exception_class(message, screen, stacktrace)\\nWebDriverException: Message: Failed to decode response from marionette\\n\\n\\nNote: This script used to work with Chrome.  Because the server is a 32bit server, I can only use chromedriver v0.33, which only supports Chrome v60-62.  Currently Chrome is v65 and on DigitalOcean I don't seem to have an easy way to revert back to an old version - which is why I am stuck with Firefox.  \n",

However it returns me incomplete read. The data I am trying to get is a huge set of nested links. I did some research online and found that this might be due to a server error (A chunked transfer encoding finishing before\\nreaching the expected size). I also found a workaround for above on this link\\nHowever, I am not sure as to how to use this for my case. Following is the code I am working on\\nbr = mechanize.Browser()\\nbr.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1;Trident/5.0)')]\\nurls = \"http://shop.o2.co.uk/mobile_phones/Pay_Monthly/smartphone/all_brands\"\\npage = urllib2.urlopen(urls).read()\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(page)\\nlinks = soup.findAll('img',url=True)\\n\\nfor tag in links:\\n    name = tag['alt']\\n    tag['url'] = urlparse.urljoin(urls, tag['url'])\\n    r = br.open(tag['url'])\\n    page_child = br.response().read()\\n    soup_child = BeautifulSoup(page_child)\\n    contracts = [tag_c['value']for tag_c in soup_child.findAll('input', {\"name\": \"tariff-duration\"})]\\n    data_usage = [tag_c['value']for tag_c in soup_child.findAll('input', {\"name\": \"allowance\"})]\\n    print contracts\\n    print data_usage\\n\\nPlease help me with this.Thanks  \n",

      My local airport disgracefully blocks users without IE, and looks awful. I want to write a Python scripts that would get the contents of the Arrival and Departures pages every few minutes, and show them in a more readable manner.\\nMy tools of choice are mechanize for cheating the site to believe I use IE, and BeautifulSoup for parsing page to get the flights data table.\\nQuite honestly, I got lost in the BeautifulSoup documentation, and can't understand how to get the table (whose title I know) from the entire document, and how to get a list of rows from that table.\\nAny ideas?  \n",

I myself loaded the full source code and referenced it as a project library only to find that things such as Applets and java.awt (used by HtmlUnit) does not exist in Android).\\nRhino - I find this very confusing and don't know how to get it working in Android and even if it is what I am looking for.\\nSelenium Driver: Looks like it can work but you don't have an straightforward way to implement it in a headless way so that you don't have the actual html displayed to a view.\\n\\nI really want HtmlUnit to work as it seems the best suited for my solution.  Is there any way or at least another library I have missed that is suitable for my needs?\\nI am currently using Android Studio 0.1.7 and can move to Ellipse if needed.\\nThanks in advance!  \n",

and it can drive Chrome for example. I was thinking, wouldn't it be far more efficient to ‘drive’ PhantomJS?\\nIs there a way to use Selenium with PhantomJS? \\nMy intended use would be web scraping: The sites I scrape are loaded with AJAX and lots of lovely JavaScript, and I’m thinking this setup could be a good replacement for the Scrapy Python framework that I’m currently working with.  \n",

match any list of tags, like so. I know attr accepts regex, but is there anything in beautiful soup that allows you to do so?\\nsoup.findAll(\"(a|div)\")\\n\\nOutput:\\n<a> ASDFS\\n<div> asdfasdf\\n<a> asdfsdf\\n\\nMy goal is to create a scraper that can grab tables from sites. Sometimes tags are named inconsistently, and I'd like to be able to input a list of tags to name the 'data' part of a table.  \n",

When screen-scraping some website, I extract data from <script> tags.\\nThe data I get is not in standard JSON format. I cannot use json.loads().\\n# from\\njs_obj = '{x:1, y:2, z:3}'\\n\\n# to\\npy_obj = {'x':1, 'y':2, 'z':3}\\n\\nCurrently, I use regex to transform the raw data to JSON format.\\nBut I feel pretty bad when I encounter complicated data structure.\\nDo you have some better solutions?  \n",

(HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);\\nHttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)oReq.GetResponse();\\n\\nvar doc = new HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument();\\n\\ndoc.Load(resp.GetResponseStream());\\nvar element = doc.GetElementbyId(\"//start-left\");\\nvar element2 = doc.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(\"//body\");\\nstring html = doc.DocumentNode.OuterHtml;\\n\\nI've seen HtmlWeb().Load to get a webpage. Is that a better alternative to load and the scrape the webpage?\\n\\nOk i'll try that instead.\\nHtmlDocument doc = web.Load(url);\\n\\nNow when i got my doc and didn't get so mutch properties. No one like SelectSingleNode. The only one I can use is GetElementById, and that works but I whant to get a class.\\nDo I need to do it like this?\\nvar htmlBody = doc.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(\"//body\");\\nhtmlBody.SelectSingleNode(\"//paging\");  \n",

up to 500,000 pages in a day, but these scrape jobs will happen at random intervals, so it's not a single queue that I can plow through. \\nWhat I'm wondering is, is it better to open a browser, go to the page, then close the browser between each job? Which I would assume would be a lot slower, but maybe handle memory better? \\nOr do I open one global browser when the app boots, and then just go to the page, and have some way to dump that page when I'm done with it (e.g. closing all tabs in chrome, but not closing chrome) then just re-open a new page when I need it? This way seems like it would be faster, but could potentially eat up lots of memory.\\nI've never worked with this library especially in a production environment, so I'm not sure if there's things I should watch out for.  \n",

extracting data from websites and parsing it into R.  \\nScraping html tables into R data frames using the XML package\\nHow can I use R (Rcurl/XML packages ?!) to scrape this webpage\\nI am very new to programming, and am just starting out with R, so I am hoping this question is pretty basic, but given those posts above, I imagine that it is.\\nAll I am looking to do is extract links that match a given pattern.  I feel like I could probably use RCurl to read in the web pages and extract them brute force method using string expressions.  That said, if the webpage is fairly well formed, how would I go about doing so using the XML package.  \\nAs I learn more, I like to \"look\" at the data as I work through the problem.  The issue is that some of these approaches generate lists of lists of lists, etc., so it is hard for someone that is new (like me) to walk through where I need to go.\\nAgain, I am very new to all that is programming, so any help or code snippets will be greatly appreciated.  \n",

Trying to debug an issue where sometimes this isn't being reset and I think I might have it.\\nI didn't want connections timing out into some infinite load time (I believe the default for Selenium is not to have a timeout) so I used:\\nDriver.set_page_load_timeout(30)\\n\\nAnd later on in that thread I would check\\nIf condition:\\n isrunning = 0\\n\\nI had originally thought that the set_page_load_timeout would just stop it loading after 30 seconds but if I'm understanding this correctly it would actually throw an exception so I'd need to do something like:\\ntry:\\n  Driver.set_page_load_timeout(30)\\nexcept:\\n  isrunning = 0\\n  Driver.Close()\\n\\n-Do whatever else in function -\\nIf condition:\\n  isrunning = 0\\n  Driver.Close()\\n\\nSo if it ran over 30 seconds it would close and set to 0 otherwise it would run on and get checked and set to 0 later.\\nI appreciate this is a tiny snippet of code but the full thing is pretty long winded and I think that's the important part.\\nI'd appreciate it if someone could confirm I have the right idea here. I'm all up for doing the testing but it's a problem which occurs once every 8 hours or so making it hard to pick apart but I think this potentially fits.  \n",

\"html5lib\"?\\nWhen would you use one over the other and the benefits of each? When I used each they seemed to be interchangeable, but people here correct me that I should be using a different one. I'd like to strengthen my understanding; I've read a couple posts on here about this but they're not going over the uses much in any at all.\\nExample:\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')  \n",

combination with selenium to scrape the links of different posts from its landing page and finally get the title of each post by tracking the url leading to its inner page. Although the content I parsed here are static ones, I used selenium to see how it works in multiprocessing. \\nHowever, my intention is to do the scraping using multiprocessing. So far I know that selenium doesn't support multiprocessing but it seems I was wrong.\\nMy question: how can I reduce the execution time using selenium when it is made to run using multiprocessing?\\nThis is my try (it's a working one):\\nimport requests\\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\\nfrom multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool\\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\\nfrom selenium import webdriver\\n\\ndef get_links(link):\\n  res = requests.get(link)\\n  soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text,\"lxml\")\\n  titles = [urljoin(url,items.get(\"href\")) for items in soup.select(\".summary .question-hyperlink\")]\\n  return titles\\n\\ndef get_title(url):\\n  chromeOptions = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\\n  chromeOptions.add_argument(\"--headless\")\\n  driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=chromeOptions)\\n  driver.get(url)\\n  sauce = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source,\"lxml\")\\n  item = sauce.select_one(\"h1 a\").text\\n  print(item)\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n  url = \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/web-scraping\"\\n  ThreadPool(5).map(get_title,get_links(url))  \n",

                I have a raw html string that I want to convert to scrapy HTML response object so that I can use the selectors css and xpath, similar to scrapy's response. How can I do it?  \n",

This question needs to be more focused. It is not currently accepting answers.\\r\\n                                \\r\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.\\n\\n\\nClosed 5 years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        Improve this question\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\nI'm working on a project that requires certain statistics from another website, and I've created an HTML scraper that gets this data every 15 minutes, automatically. However, I stopped the bot now, as in their terms of use, they mention they do not allow it.\\nI really want to respect this, and especially if there's a law prohibiting me from taking this data, but I've been contacting them through email several times without a single answer, so now I've come to the conclusion that I'll simply grab the data, if it is legal.\\nOn certain forums I've read that it IS legal, but I would much rather get a more \"precise\" answer here on StackOverflow.\\nAnd let's say that this is in fact not illegal, would they have any software to spot my bot making several connections every 15 minutes?\\nAlso, when talking about taking their data, we're talking about a single number for each \"team\", and this number I will transfer in to our own number.
